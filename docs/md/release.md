Find the current stable released executables and archived source files here. For Linux there is the Linux executable and Debian installer&#46; If anyone wants to fork or submit to the MacOs version then please be my guest&#46;

For any version of the binary you&#39;ll probably want to change the name of the executable to just&#58; *`lspids`*&#46;
